	abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic ﬁnite element (SFE) within a general purpose ﬁnite element analysis program ABAQUS to simulate the probabilistic structural response of stochastic materials. Discretization and quantiﬁcation of random ﬁelds associated with material uncertainties are accomplished through Karhunen–Loeve (KL) expansion in order to simulate the stochastic response of structures under material uncertainties. Although SFE is one of the most widely accepted approaches, its integrations into general-purpose ﬁnite element software are rare in literatures due to difﬁculties in its intrusive formulation and managing two different meshes for discretizing the physical and random ﬁeld domains subjected to different meshing criteria. Therefore, issues on the separation of RF mesh from FE mesh have been addressed along with its efﬁcient implementations. The proposed method can signiﬁcantly reduce dimensionality of the stochastic domain and efﬁciently predict probability density functions of the structural response under material uncertainties through Monte Carlo simulations combined with the Latin hypercube sampling technique.},

	abstract = {This papers makes a brief review, in a relatively complete methodological framework, of various global sensitivity analysis methods of model output. Numerous statistical and probabilistic tools (regression, smoothing, tests, statistical learning, Monte Carlo, . . . ) aim at determining the model input variables which mostly contribute to an interest quantity depending of model output (as the variance of an output variable). Three kinds of methods are distinguished: the screening (coarse sorting of the most inﬂuential inputs among a large number), the measures of importance (quantitative sensitivity indices) and the deep exploration of the model behaviour (measuring the effects of inputs on their all variation range). A progressive application methodology is illustrated on a scholar application. A synthesis is given to place every method according to three axes: cost in number of model evaluations, model complexity and nature of brought information.},
