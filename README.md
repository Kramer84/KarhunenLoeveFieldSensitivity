# stochastic_process_analysis

This repository contains codes used for sensitity analysis on models governed by stochastic processes and random input variables. 
They were done in the frame of an internship at PHIMECA in Clermont-Ferrand.

To use the codes, please install the virtual environment provided in the yaml file.
