# stochastic_process_analysis

This repository contains codes used for sensitity analysis on models governed by stochastic processes and random input variables. 
They were done in the frame of an internship at [PHIMECA](http://www.phimeca.com/) in Clermont-Ferrand.

## Getting Started

To use the codes, please install the virtual environment provided in the yaml file. A throughout example can be found in the 
"Demo Analyse de sensibilit√© poutre" notebook, but for the moment only in french (Sorry).

### Prerequisites

Works with python 3.6, but should work with other versions of python through the intensive usage of numpy.

Important packages used:
 - openTURNS
 - NumPy
 - Numba (not really used, but acceleration could be intersting)
 - anastruct (for the random beam example)
 - mayavi.mlab (simple 3 dimensional plotting)

### Installing

The environment installation is simple, just have conda install and paste that line in your terminal
```
conda env create -f  sensitivityEnv.yml
```


## Usage

```python
import StochasticProcessConstructor as SPC
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

stochasticProcess = SPC.StochasticProcessConstructor() 
stochasticProcess.setDimension(2)
stochasticProcess.setGrid([[0,100,100],[0,100,100],])
stochasticProcess.setCovarianceModel({'Model':'MaternModel','scale':[25,25],'amplitude':[5],'nu':3.})
realization = stochasticProcess.getRealization(True)
plt.imshow(realization)
```

## Contributing

As this project is done in the frame of an internship with the company PHIMECA in Clermont-Ferrand, France, i should be the only one commiting for now.
